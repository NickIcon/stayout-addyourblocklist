Block list collection for all needs.

THIS BLOCK LIST COLLECTION STARTS BASED ON THE #blockback IDEA: 
===============================================================
Upcoming EU copyright law targets to the end of internet usage as we are used to in european union.
If that law is passed, 500 Million users are affected. Lots of startups, mid and small size internet companies, 
will lose their bussiness model, can go offline and find new jobs.

As a form of individual protest and for those people who do not like to leave their sofa for public protests,
this blocklist-collection starts with a incomplete and likely erroneous list of websites 
that are either owned by the initiators of that disastrous law or where they have shares in.
The idea is: If they block you from using the internet as free law repecting person, if they destroy your bussiness, 
block their (f***ing) websites on your private devices and never go there again.

You can add it to your private filter list in the free adBlocker uBlock Origin (see https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) 
available for almost all browsers or add it to ROUTERS filter list, if you think you need to protect your family from access to this kind of websites.

IN ADDITION:
============
Check the block lists (blockback-ubo.txt [uBlock], blockback-fb.txt [fritz!box]) before copy/pasting them, remove false positive, enhance them by your own, in brief: Do whatever you like to with this lists.


WELCOME ARE:
==========
- proposals for changes, enhancements, error correction, deletion of false positvices of existing lists.
- new list for other purposes (e.g. malware blocking, porn blocking, etc. ...).
